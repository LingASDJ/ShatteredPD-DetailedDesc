# ShatteredPixelDungeon-DetailedDescVersion #

A private mod of ShatteredPixelDungeon (Evan) working as a dictionary and a tester.

Aim to help dungeon players know the data and mechanics of game, and have a platform to test game data and mechanics.

*****************NOTE THAT*****************

- All the description are ONLY available in CHINESE. 

- Currently this version is ONLY distributed in Tencent PD groups in China.

*****************Main Features*****************

- Detailed descrption for most items, creatures, plants etc. and important mechanics of game.

- TestMode that has convinet access to most items and can travel between floors.

- A few interesting and hard challenges or expansions to distinguish with original Shattered and improve play experience. Content might be somewhat limited because I can't make too many changes to original ShPD code, or it would be a disaster when transfering between versions.

- And other parts of the game is TOTALLY UNCHANGED to keep inline with the original ShatterdPD.

*****************More*****************

- This project is built with Android Studio. 

- v091 is not where this mod started. It started from Shattered ~v072, but it was very messy and much less functional until Shattered ~v081.

- Update (usually) each time when ShatteredPD releases a major version.

- Since the gameplay is almost the same to original ShPD, you can just regard it as a dictionary.
